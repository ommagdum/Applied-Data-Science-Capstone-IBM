# SpaceX Falcon 9 First Stage Landing Prediction - Data Science Capstone Project

Welcome to the "SpaceX Falcon 9 First Stage Landing Prediction" repository. This project is part of a Data Science Capstone, where I assume the role of a Data Scientist working for a startup intending to compete with SpaceX. Throughout this project, I follow the Data Science methodology, which includes data collection, data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, model development, model evaluation, and reporting results to stakeholders.
## Project Overview
The main goal of this project is to predict whether the first stage of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket will successfully land. By leveraging Data Science skills and the models developed in this project, the startup I work for can make more informed bids against SpaceX for rocket launches.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/yourusername/spacex-landing-prediction.git
      cd spacex-landing-prediction

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
      pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Open the Jupyter notebooks to explore the data and run the analyses (Shift + Enter in a cell to run it)

4. Run the Dash application for interactive visualizations:
   ```bash
      python spacex_dash_app.py

## Project Workflow
The project follows a structured workflow as outlined below:
1. Data Collection: Gather data from various sources including APIs and web scraping.
2. Data Wrangling: Clean and preprocess the data to make it suitable for analysis.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform EDA to understand the data and extract insights.
4. Data Visualization: Create visualizations to represent the data and findings.
5. Model Development: Develop machine learning models to predict the landing outcome.
6. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the models to ensure they meet the performance criteria.
7. Reporting: Summarize the findings and present them to stakeholders.
